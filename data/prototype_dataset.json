    "content": "A brief career retrospective. This post has been in drafts for over a year now. I wrote this as a response to the countless messages I get on Linkedin/Twitter asking how to move to a product role. Over the past 5 years I have worked for various startups, built a few interesting products and switched from a developer to a product manager. This is also my attempt to summarise my career as it stands now and includes learnings from my previous jobs. I have worked at: IOCL (Summer Intern, May 2011 — Jul 2011, 3 months), NGOSphere (Attempt at starting up, Nov 2011 — Jul 2012, 9 months), Redbus (Summer Intern, May 2012 — Jul 2012, 3 months), Avaya (Final Semester Intern, Jan 2013 — Jul 2013, 6 months), KonyLabs (Full time, Aug 2013 — Sept 2013, 2 months), Kore.ai (Full time, Oct 2013 — Nov 2014, 1 year 2 months), CouponDunia (Full time, Dec 2014 — Dec 2015, 1 year 1 month), Craftsvilla (Full time, Jan 2016 — Sept 2016, 9 months), Directi (Full time, Since Dec 2016, Current). IOCL and Avaya were easy. I just had to fill a form and let my college (BITS) and my CGPA (6.0/10) take care of the rest. Thanks to my CGPA I knew I had no chance of getting internships at top tier firms. I tried to learn as much as I could at both places, and got a few good projects under my belt. Learnings: There was no way I could see myself doing a government job. The 3 months at IOCL was enough for me to realise that. I got interested in management while at IOCL. I took a project related Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)at IOCL and I started a habit of reading as much as I could about best management practices. At Avaya, I learnt how big companies run. I was part of sprints, planning meetings for the first time. I also understood how products get built: customer research, prototyping, alpha releases etc. RedBus: I got into RedBus thanks to something I learnt quite early in my life: there are few people in this world who have the audacity to go after what they really want in life. At BITS, I saw a friend of mine send out close to 200 applications to professors all over the world to land a summer internship abroad. There were people who had much better CGPA. There were people who probably were better at Computer Science than him. But none of them had his drive. My only experience till 3rd year of college was a summer internship at IOCL and a failed attempt at starting up. Inspired by my friend, I decided to send out as many applications as possible, no matter how many rejections I got. Thankfully the first email itself worked. Shankar Prasad, the COO, told me that RedBus was exploring expansion in the North East. They had started operations almost a year before, but they had very few tie ups and hence wanted someone to go there. My work was to convince bus operators & travel agencies to partner with RedBus, scale up RedBus's operations and run a few marketing projects. I don't know why they felt that I was the guy who could do that, but I was still thankful and jumped at the opportunity. Learnings: I realised how much I loved working for a fast paced startup which was in hyper scaling mode. There was no bureaucracy. You did not have to please your manager and could just go out and do your own stuff. I never felt like a lowly paid intern. I was hustling in the North East, trying to figure out a way to grow RedBus there. I studied the travel industry in and out. In the 3 months I was with Redbus I helped double their partners in the North East. Even then I was looking at unique ways I could be valuable for a corporation. Being from the North East helped. I realized that if everything fails in my life, I could still become a city manager for some startup in Guwahati. I got solid recommendations and learnt a lot, something I could never had done at a big corporation. I Learnt a lot about how culture is important for a startup. At RedBus, Phani (the CEO) used to send Happy Birthday mails to employees. My manager Subhobrata did his best to let me have the freedom to do what I wanted. Even if I was just there just for 3 months, I felt like I was part of the company. People were quick to praise your work and make you feel important. NGOSphere: During my 2nd year of college I got fascinated with the world of startups. This was the beginning of the startup boom in India. Everywhere I turned, I could see people starting up. Also maybe, I was reading too much TechCrunch. Here was the idea: There were around 2 million NGOs in India in 2011. Our goal was to get at least 1% of them online. Provide them various services: web site development, brochure design, fund raising, branding. Our goal was to start a web design agency and target only this market. Learnings: Finding a datapoint like 2 million NGOs are in India means nothing. We were stupid to assume most of them want to come online and the only thing lacking was a push by us. Most NGOs in India are just tax avoidance scams. They don't care whether people know about them or not. Even if you manage to convince a few of them to work with you, they will bail at the last minute. The typical excuse would be lack of funds, directors thought otherwise and were no longer interested. Market validation is really important. We assumed NGOs would use the brand presence to raise more funding. We assumed NGOs would be willing to pay us for digital services. Golden rule of starting up: Never assume. Talk to potential customers. See if they are willing to pay. We were more interested in getting our visiting cards printed, updating our Linkedin bio. I promised never to do something again in life just because it was the cool thing to do. It was a humbling experience, getting rejected by so many people. Thankfully something good came out of it: I learnt a lot of lessons which helped me do well in the RedBus internship and later move to a product role. Another co founder started Halaplay and is doing quite well. KonyLabs and Kore.ai: Depending on college placements was the stupidest mistake I made. I was hoping some fast growing startup would come to college and offer me some Business Development or Marketing position. I was not that keen on moving to a developer role. Coding never excited me in college, and I did not know then that something like product management existed. I did not even interview for most of the software companies which came in the beginning of placement season. Only after almost the entire placements were done, I realised what a mistake I had made; with a 6.0 (/10) CGPA I was in deep waters. I had not applied anywhere off campus too. I was running out of options. So I did what any sane guy at my situation would do: Read Cormen (textbook on Data Structures) cover to cover and started sitting for interviews. I still kept getting rejected (messing up in the final rounds of a few companies) and was one of the last guys in my Computer Science batch to get placed. It was a humbling experience. My father would call me every night asking when Microsoft/Google is coming and I had to remind him again and again that with my CGPA I was not even eligible to sit for their interviews. I finally got placed in a startup called Kony Labs. I joined their team which used Kony Studio (their proprietary platform) to build apps for various companies.The advantage of Kony Studio is that it can generate builds for multiple platforms from a single JS codebase. I worked at KonyLabs for just 2 months before joining Kore, which spun out from the company. It had the same management team and their goal was to build the next generation workplace collaboration platform. It was the best decision I made. Instead of being one of the 100s of developers I was not part of a small startup where I could learn faster. I would go on to work on the Android app before moving to the Server team. Learnings: Most things in life boils down to luck. I could have remained at Kony and kept working on their proprietary platform. It would not have helped me a lot career wise. But due to some random selection I ended up being one of the few freshers moved to Kore.ai. Working at Kore was fun mostly, but with periods of extreme frustration. I felt we were moving too slow and needed to ship much faster if we wanted to have any chance against Slack. Speed is indeed something which can make or break early startups. There was no north star to speak of. Worked under an amazing Tech lead. I understood why they say the effective Tech Lead is a 100x engineer. I learnt a lot during my time at Kore. I had no clue about APIs before I joined Kore. I did not know the difference between SOAP and REST properly. One and a half year of writing code helped me learn how to actually roll up my sleeves and build products myself. It also helped me become more emphatic later as a PM, having been a dev myself. I realised I could never become a good enough dev to work at Google or Amazon. Instead of reading tech blogs I spent far more time reading product development blogs. If I could not finish my work, I would just go home and have a sound sleep, without being up all night figuring out the fix. CouponDunia: While I was at Kore, I received this time capsule I had set in 2012. This capsule was from a mediocre college student who wanted his future self to answer this simple question: Did you make something good out of your life or are you still getting screwed? I realised that even though I could continue at Kore, working as a developer, I did not see myself as a coder 10 years down the line. So I thought why waste any more time? I told my manager that I was quitting and put in my papers. I had a 2 months notice period and in the worst case I was willing to go back to being a dev. Or maybe I could just join a startup as a Product Management intern? I was willing to take the risk. I had been thinking about the switch for a long time and I knew I would just keep thinking about it and not do anything if I was not pushing myself hard enough and showed enough intent. And what is the best way to show intent than quitting your safe job without a new job offer! Instead of writing on how I prepared for Product Management interviews in particular I am linking some really good resources here. I have also already written on how to look for startup jobs. I followed the exact same approach. Kept pitching to CEOs/Head of Products on how I can add value. Being a generalist really helped to get a foot in the door. But a lack of prior product experience led to a lot of rejections too. Finally I interviewed with 2 startups- CouponDunia and Zoomcar. I had connected with Sameer, the CEO of CouponDunia on Angellist and I sent my pitch to him. I wrote a long product critique of the app as well as the website. I even found broken links. I had seen how people apply at companies without even using their products. I wanted to show that I cared about the company. I had invested enough time to understand the market as well as the existing products. All I wanted now was a chance. Learnings: I have already written about my work at CouponDunia. About transitioning to a Product role: 19 lessons I learned during my first year as a Product Manager. Craftsvilla: I was loving my life at CouponDunia. I had a boss who liked me, who gave me the freedom to do whatever I wanted. But I also realised that I was getting too comfortable in my life/career. I was no longer learning as much. I had scaled CashBoss to 1million installs and profitability but if we were to reach the next level, we would need a far bigger investment in Marketing. I was also seriously contemplating switching to one of the Rocket Ships. People suggest you to jump into one, no matter what role you get. I was helping a few other startups during this time including one which eventually got acquired by Quikr. It was during that time Craftsvilla reached out to me. It was supposed to be a random coffee meet with the VP of Product but things turned out for the good and I got a job offer. The following points made the role really exciting: Craftsvilla was one of the fast growing rocketships you read on various startup blogs. Funded by top investors it had raised a massive round at a valuation of around 200 mil and there were talks about a listing on NASDAQ. One of my long term goals then was to move into VC after getting enough startup experience. I thought this would be a good opportunity to work and network with people in the industry. Almost all the VPs at Craftsvilla were ex VCs. Lastly my role: I was being offered the chance to head mobile apps which seemed too good of a role to refuse. I talked about ways to demonstrate value earlier. Even before I officially joined Craftsvilla, I started working on growth. Thinking about how to make Craftsvilla the next unicorn was all I could think of. Learnings: Learnt how to make decisions with data. Every feature you pitch at Craftsvilla had to be backed with metrics and every release supposed to improve on Conversion. Got domain knowledge of the e-commerce industry; from logistics to category management to merchandising. Understood how highly funded VC funded startups work from the inside. By the end of 9 months I had a sad realisation: Most of the people I enjoyed working with had left due to various issues. The Indian startup ecosystem was in turmoil. Every day you could see startups shutting down. Raising new rounds was becoming harder by the day. And Indian e-commerce sector is still in its infancy. Customer retention is hard. Every one is just burning money to retain people who wont think twice before shopping at your competitor for a 10% extra discount. Even the market leader Flipkart is still bleeding losses. Directi: I spent the next 3 months at home. For a change I did not have to respond to mails asking why conversion dropped by 20% on a Sunday afternoon. I met quite a few startups (based in Guwahati). It was good fun but time was running out. I needed to look for a job again. I evaluated my options. I did not want to join another e-commerce company unless it was a market leader. Chat platforms were becoming huge. Lot of interesting companies working in the space. I had read like 100 blogposts on Wechat already. So I decided to apply to the only two companies in India working on Chat: Hike and Flock. I wrote a 10 pager on how to take Hike to the next level and sent it to their Head of Growth. I also dropped a mail to Bhavin, the CEO of Directi. Fun fact: When I say I hope this somehow lands in your inbox I meant it literally. I normally don't go through the typical HR route and just reach out to the Hiring manager/Head of Product/ CEO with a value proposition mail. And I sure as hope it lands on their Inbox and not the spam folder. I managed to get into Directi and join their Apps team. I have been working on exactly the same things I mentioned in the mail. There have been pros as well as cons but there won't be a retrospective section for Directi for now. That's all folks! Why I wrote this? I know there is no point writing a retrospective for your career when it has not even been 5 years since you passed out of college. This might even look narcissistic somehow. But I did end up doing a lot of things in my life over the last few years which I wanted as a teenager in college. I did not go to any MBA school. I worked at various promising startups and gave my best (till I could, and then moved on). I hope this inspires someone who is still at college and wondering whether they can ever find modest level of professional success. This also answers how I got into Product. Thanks for reading.",

    "title": "13 Ways to Fight Sugar Cravings",
    "content": "Does that morning Danish pastry leave you craving another treat 2 hours later? Do you grab a candy bar to cope with your afternoon slump and then reach for a cola to get out of your post-slump slump? If you've found that munching sugary snacks just makes you crave more of them, you're not alone. Eating lots of simple carbohydrates without the backup of proteins or fats can quickly satisfy hunger and give your body a short-term energy boost. But they almost as quickly leave you famished again and wanting more. How can you stop sugar cravings once and for all? Here's expert advice. Why Do We Crave Sugar? There are many reasons why we go for sweet things. That appetite may be hardwired. Sweet is the first taste humans prefer from birth, says Christine Gerbstadt, MD. Carbohydrates stimulate the release of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin. Sugar is a carbohydrate, but carbohydrates come in other forms, too, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which have fiber and nutrients your body needs. The taste of sugar also releases endorphins that calm and relax us, and offer a natural high, says Susan Moores, a registered dietitian and nutrition consultant in St. Paul, MN. Sweets just taste good, too. And that preference gets reinforced when you reward yourself with sweet treats, which can make you crave it even more. With all that going for it, why wouldn't we crave sugar? The problem comes not when we indulge in a sweet treat now and then, but when we overdo it. That's easy to do when sugar is added to many processed foods, including breads, yogurt, juices, and sauces. And Americans do overeat it, averaging 17 teaspoons of added sugars per day, according to the American Heart Association, which recommends limiting added sugars to about 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 for men. How to Stop Sugar Cravings: 8 Tips to Use Right Now. If you're craving sugar, here are some ways to tame those cravings. Give in a little. Eat a bit of what you're craving, maybe a small cookie or a fun-size candy bar, suggests Kerry Neville, a registered dietitian. Enjoying a little of what you love can help you steer clear of feeling denied. Try to stick to a 150-calorie threshold, Neville says. If you can't find a small serving size, split your treat with a friend or friends. Combine foods. If the idea of stopping at a cookie or a baby candy bar seems impossible, you can still fill yourself up and satisfy a sugar craving, too. I like combining the craving food with a healthful one, Neville says. I love chocolate, for example, so sometimes I'll dip a banana in chocolate sauce and that gives me what I'm craving, or I mix some almonds with chocolate chips. You'll soothe your craving and get healthy nutrients from those good-for-you foods. Go cold turkey. Cutting out all simple sugars works for some people. But it's not easy. The initial 48 to 72 hours are tough, Gerbstadt says. Some people find that going cold turkey helps curb their cravings after a few days. Others find they may still crave sugar but over time are able to train their taste buds to be satisfied with less. Grab some gum. If you want to avoid giving in to a sugar craving completely, try chewing a stick of gum, says registered dietitian Dave Grotto. Research has shown that chewing gum can reduce food cravings, Grotto says. Reach for fruit. Keep fruit handy for when sugar cravings hit. You'll get fiber and nutrients along with some sweetness. And stock up on foods like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits, says certified addiction specialist Judy Chambers. Have them handy so you reach for them instead of reaching for the old sugary something. Get up and go. When a sugar craving hits, walk away. Take a walk around the block or do something to change the scenery, to take your mind off the food you're craving, Neville suggests. Choose quality over quantity. If you need a sugar splurge, pick a wonderful, decadent sugary food, Moores says. But keep it small. For example, choose a small dark chocolate truffle instead of a king-sized candy bar, then savor every bite slowly, Moores says. Grotto agrees. Don't swear off favorites you'll only come back for greater portions. Learn to incorporate small amounts in the diet but concentrate on filling your stomach with less sugary and healthier options. Eat regularly. Waiting too long between meals may set you up to choose sugary, fatty foods that cut your hunger, Moores says. Instead, eating every 3 to 5 hours can help keep blood sugar stable and help you avoid irrational eating behavior, Grotto says. Your best bets? Choose protein, fiber-rich foods like whole grains and produce, Moores says. But won't eating more often mean overeating? Not if you follow Neville's advice to break up your meals. For instance, have part of your breakfast a slice of toast with peanut butter, perhaps and save some yogurt for a mid-morning snack. Break up lunch the same way to help avoid a mid-afternoon slump, Neville says. Also, you may need to rethink your drinks. They can be a major source of sugar, whether it's a soda, a latte, or juice. Try a sparkling water or plain water instead. How to Stop Sugar Cravings: 5 Tips for the Long Term. One of the best ways to manage sugar cravings is to stop them before they start. To help you do that: Skip artificial sweeteners. They don't necessarily lessen cravings for sugar. And they haven't demonstrated a positive effect on our obesity epidemic, says Grotto, author of 101 Foods That Could Save Your Life. Reward yourself for successfully managing sugar cravings. Your reward could be large or small. Remember why you're working on it and then reward yourself for each successful step. Slow down. For 1 week, focus on your sugar cravings and think about what you're eating, suggests Chambers. Diet mayhem often results from lack of planning. So slow down, plan, and eat what you intend to eat, instead of eating when you're desperate, Chambers says. Get support. Many people turn to sweet foods when they're stressed, depressed, or angry. But food doesn't solve emotional issues. Consider whether emotions are involved in your sugar cravings and whether you need help to find other solutions to those emotional problems. Mix it up. You may need more than one strategy to thwart sugar cravings. One week you may find success with one tactic, and another week calls for an alternative approach. What's important is to have a bag of tricks to try, Gerbstadt says. To tame sugar cravings, you really need to figure out what works for you, Neville says. Lastly, go easy on yourself. It may take time to get a handle on your sugar cravings. It's difficult to shift any system whether it's the world economy or your eating, Chambers says.",

    "title": "A few things I've learned about email marketing",
    "content": "Hello! I've been learning a lot about business over the last few years (it's possible to make a living by helping people learn! it's amazing!). One of the things I've found hardest to get my head around was email marketing. Like a lot of people, I get a lot of unwanted email, and at first I was really opposed to doing any kind of email marketing because I was worried I'd be the source of that unwanted email. But I've learned how to do it in a way that feels good to me, and where the replies to my marketing emails are usually along the lines of \"wow, I love this, thank you so much!\". (literally: here are excerpts from the last 20 or so replies I've gotten) I'm going to structure this as a series of beliefs I had about email marketing that turned out not to be universally true. myth 1: selling things is an adversarial relationship I used to think that selling things was a sort of adversarial relationship: the person selling the product wants to convince the buyer (by any means necessary) to spend as much money as possible, and that people buying things are usually kind of resentful of anyone asking them to spend money. I've learned that actually a lot of people are happy (or even actively want) to spend money on something that will help them solve a problem they have. Here's a silly example of something illustrating this: 2 years ago, we'd hired someone to paint our new apartment. We decided to paint a lot of the walls white, and we were stuck with the impossible problem of deciding which of the 10 billion possible shades of white to paint the walls. I found a $27 ebook called white is complicated, and (long story short, this blog post is not about painting) it really helped me confidently choose a shade of white!! We spent thousands of dollars on painting, so $30 was a really good investment in making sure we'd be happy with the result. So even though $27 for an ebook on how to choose a white seems silly at first, I was really happy to spend the money, and my guess is a lot of other people who bought that ebook are as well. The bigger idea here is that it's easier to run a business when you're selling to people who are happy to buy things based on the value they're getting from the product. In my case, I've found that there are lots of programmers who are happy to pay for clear, short, friendly explanations of concepts they need to understand for their jobs. a quick note on how I learned these things: 30x500 I originally wrote this blog post about all these things I learned, and it kind of read like I figured out all of these things naturally over the course of running a business. But that's not how it went at all! I've actually found it very hard to debug business problems on my own. A lot of the attitudes I had when I started out running a business were counterproductive (like thinking of selling something as an adversarial process), and I don't know that many people who run similar businesses who I can get advice from. I learned how to think about selling things as a non-adversarial process (and everything else in this blog post, and a lot more) from 30x500, a business class by Amy Hoy (her writing is here) and Alex Hillman that I bought a couple of years ago. 30x500 is about running a specific kind of business (very briefly: sell to people who buy based on value, decide what to build by researching your audience, market by teaching people helpful things), which happens to be the exact kind of business that I run. It's been a really great way to learn how to run my business better. Okay, back to my misconceptions about email marketing! myth 2: sending email is inherently bad The next thing I believed was that sending email from a business was somehow inherently bad and that all marketing email was unwanted. I now realize this is untrue even for normal marketing emails – for example, lots of people subscribe to marketing newsletters for brands they like because they want to hear about new products when they come out & sales. But marketing emails aren't just \"not inherently bad\", they can actually be really useful! marketing is about building trust When I started sending out business emails, I based them on the emails I was used to receiving – I'd announce new zines I'd written, and explain why the zine was useful. But what I've learned is that (at least for me) marketing isn't about describing your product to the audience, marketing is about building trust by helping people. So, instead of just periodically emailing out \"hey, here's a new zine, here's why it's good\", my main marketing email list is called saturday comics, and it sends you 1 email a week with a programming comic. What I like about this approach to marketing (\"just help people learn things for free\") is that it's literally just what I love doing anyway – I wrote this blog to help people learn things for free for years just because I think it's fun to help people learn. And people love the Saturday Comics! And it makes money – I announce new zines to that list as well, and lots of people buy them. It's really simple and nice! myth 3: you have to trick people into signing up for your email marketing list One pattern I see a lot is that I sign up for some free service, and then I start getting deluged with marketing emails trying to convince me to upgrade to the paid tier or whatever. I used to think that this was how marketing emails had to work – you somehow get people's email and then send them email, and hope that for some reason (???) they decide to buy things from you. But, of course, this isn't true! If your marketing list is actually just full of genuinely helpful emails, and you can describe who it's intended for clearly (give people a link to the archive to see if they like what they see!), then a lot of people will be happy to sign up and receive the emails! If you clearly communicate who your mailing list will help, then people can easily filter themselves in, and the only people on the list will be happy to be on the list. And then you don't have to send any unwanted email at all! Hooray! Here's one story that influenced how I think about this: once I sent an email to everyone who had bought a past zine saying \"hey, I just released this other zine, maybe you want to buy it!\". And I got an angry reply from someone saying something like \"why are you emailing me, I just bought that one thing from you, I don't want you to keep emailing me about other things\". I decided that I agreed with that, and now I'm more careful about being clear about what kinds of emails people are opting into. marketing is about communicating clearly & honestly One insight (from Alex Hillman) that helped me a lot recently was – when someone is dissatisfied with something they bought, it doesn't always mean that the product is \"bad\". Maybe the product is helpful to many other people! But it definitely means that the person's expectations weren't met. A tiny example: one of the few refund requests I've gotten for a zine was from someone from who expected there to be more information about sed in the zine, and they were disappointed there was only 1 page about sed. So if I communicate clearly & accurately what problems a product solves, who it's for, and how it solves those problems, people are much more likely to be delighted when they buy it and be happy to buy from me again in the future!. For my zines specifically, I like to make the table of contents very easy to find so that people can see that there's 1 page about sed :) myth 4: you have to constantly produce new emails I've tried and failed to start a lot of mailing lists. the pattern I kept getting stuck in was: I have an idea for a weekly mailing list I send 2 emails I give up forever This was partly because I thought that to have a weekly/biweekly mailing list, you have to write new emails every week. And some people definitely do mailing lists this way, like Austin Kleon. But I learned that there's a different way to write a mailing list! Instead, you: put together a list of your best articles / comics / whatever when someone subscribes to that list, send them 1 email a week (or every 2 weeks, or whatever) with one article from the List Of Your Best Articles The point is most people in the world probably haven't already read your best articles, and so if you just send them one article a week from that list, it'll probably actually be MORE helpful to them than if you were writing a new article every week. And you don't need to write any emails every week! I think this is called a \"drip marketing campaign\", but when I search for that term I don't find the results super helpful – there's a lot out there about tools to do this, but as with anything I think the actual content of the emails is the most important thing. myth 5: unsubscribes are the end of the world Another email marketing thing I used to get stressed out about was unsubscribes. It always feels a little sad to send an email about something I'm excited about and see 20 people unsubscribe immediately, even if it's only 0.3% of people on the mailing list. But I know that I subscribe to mailing lists very liberally, even on topics that I'm not that interested in, and 70% of the time I decide that I'm not that interested in the topic and unsubscribe eventually. A small percentage of people unsubscribing really just isn't that big of a deal. myth 6: you need to optimize your open rates There are all kinds of analytics you can do with email marketing, like open rates. I love numbers and analyzing things, but so far I really haven't found trying to A/B test or optimize my numbers to be that productive or healthy. I'd rather spend my energy on just writing more helpful things for people to read. The most important thing I've learned about website analytics is that it's unproductive to look at random statistics like \"the open rate on this email is 43% but the last one was 47%\" and wonder what they mean. What has been helpful has been coming up with a few specific questions that are important to me (\"are people visiting this page from links on other sites, or only from my links?\") and keeping very rough track of the answers over time. So far I've really never used any of the tracking features of my email marketing software. The only thing I've done that I've found helpful is: sometimes when I release a new zine I'll send out a discount code to people on the list, and I can tell if people bought the thing from the mailing list because they used the discount code. it's important to remember there are people on the other side The last thing that's helped me is to remember that even though emailing thousands of people sometimes feels like a weird anonymous thing, there are a lot of very delightful people on the other side! So when I write emails, I usually try to imagine that I'm writing to some very nice person I met at a conference one time who told me that they like my blog. We're not best friends, but they know my work to some extent, and they're interested to hear what I have to say. I often like to remind people why they're getting the email, especially if I haven't emailed that list for a long time – \"you signed up to get announcements when I release a new zine, so here's an announcement!\". I think the technical email marketing term for this is a list being \"cold\" and \"warm\", like if you don't email a list for too long it's \"cold\" and your subscribers might have forgotten that they're on it. that's all! When I started, I was really convinced that email marketing was this terrible, awful thing that I could not do that mostly involved tricking people into getting emails they don't want (ok, I'm exaggerating a bit, but I really struggled with it). But it's possible to do it in a transparent way where I'm mostly just sending people helpful emails that they do want! The big surprise for me was that email marketing is not a monolithic thing. I have a lot of choices about how to do it, and if I don't like the way someone else does email marketing, I can just make different choices when doing it myself!",

    "title": "13 Simple Ways to Stop Eating Lots of Sugar",
    "content": "Many drinks, sauces, and breakfast foods contain more sugar than you might realize. Reading product labels can be a helpful first step to lowering your added sugar intake. You can also limit added sugars by choosing whole foods and full-fat foods over processed and low-fat versions. Eating too much sugar may be devastating for your health. Added sugar, which is the sugar found in sodas, sweets, and other processed foods, has been shown to contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and tooth decay. Research suggests that most Americans eat anywhere from 55–92 grams of added sugar daily, which is equivalent to 13–22 teaspoons of table sugar each day — representing about 12–16% of daily calorie intake. This is significantly more than the Dietary Guidelines for Americans' recommendation of getting less than 10% of your daily calories from added sugars. The World Health Organization goes a step further, recommending less than 5% of calories from added sugar for optimal health. However, it can be challenging to slash added sugars from your diet. This article lists 13 simple ways to stop eating so much sugar. 1. Cut back on sugary drinks Most added sugars in the American diet come from sugary drinks — sodas, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened teas, and others. Additionally, drinks that many people perceive as healthy, such as smoothies and fruit juices, can still contain astounding amounts of added sugar. For example, 1 cup (271 grams) of cranberry juice cocktail contains more than 7 teaspoons of sugar (31 grams). Additionally, your body doesn't recognize calories from drinks in the same way as those from food. Calories from drinks are absorbed quickly, resulting in a rapid increase in your blood sugar level. Drinks also don't make you feel as full as solid food, so people who consume lots of calories from drinks don't eat less to compensate. Reducing your intake of sugary drinks can help with weight loss and improve overall health. Here are some healthier beverage options that are naturally low in sugar: water, unsweetened sparkling water, herbal teas, black or green tea, coffee. 2. Avoid sugary desserts Most desserts don't provide much in the way of nutritional value. They're loaded with sugar, which causes blood sugar spikes that can leave you feeling tired and hungry and make you crave more sugar. Grain- and dairy-based desserts, such as cakes, pies, doughnuts, and ice cream, account for more than 18% of the intake of added sugar in the American diet. If you want something lower in added sugar that can still satisfy your sweet tooth, try these alternatives: fresh fruit, Greek yogurt with cinnamon or fruit, baked fruit with cream, dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher). A bonus of eating whole fruit? Swapping sugar-heavy desserts for fresh or baked fruit not only reduces your sugar intake but also increases the fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in your diet. 3. Avoid sauces with added sugar Sauces like ketchup, barbecue sauce, spaghetti sauce, and sweet chili sauce are commonplace in most kitchens. However, most people aren't aware of their sugar content. A 1-tablespoon (17-gram) serving of ketchup contains about 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of sugar. That means ketchup is a whopping 29% sugar — more sugary than ice cream. Look for condiments and sauces labeled \"no added sugar\" to cut back on the hidden sugars in these products. Other options for seasoning your food that are naturally low in added sugars include herbs and spices, chili, mustard, vinegar, pesto, mayonnaise, and lemon or lime juice. 4. Eat full-fat foods Low fat varieties of your favorite foods — like peanut butter, yogurt, and salad dressing — are everywhere. If you've been told that fat is bad, it may feel natural to reach for these alternatives rather than the full-fat versions — especially when you're trying to lose weight. However, the unsettling truth is that they usually contain more sugar and sometimes more calories than their full-fat counterparts. For example, a 6-ounce (170-gram) serving of low fat vanilla yogurt contains 24 grams of sugar and 144 calories. The same amount of full-fat plain yogurt contains just 8 grams of naturally occurring milk sugar and only 104 calories. High sugar intake has also been shown to cause weight gain, which negates the reason you might have chosen a low fat food in the first place. When you're trying to cut your sugar intake, it's often better to choose full-fat foods instead. But make sure to read the list of ingredients so you can make the better choice. 5. Eat whole foods Whole foods haven't been processed or refined. They are also free of additives and other artificial substances. These foods include whole fruits, legumes, whole grains, vegetables, and meat on the bone. At the other end of the spectrum are ultra-processed foods. These are prepared foods that contain salt, sugar, fat, and additives in combinations that are engineered to taste amazing — which makes it hard to moderate your intake of these foods. Examples of ultra-processed foods are soft drinks, sugary cereals, chips, and fast food. Almost 90% of the added sugars in the average American's diet come from ultra-processed foods, whereas only 8.7% come from foods prepared from scratch at home using whole foods. Try to cook from scratch when possible, so you can avoid added sugars. You don't have to cook elaborate meals. Simple preparations like marinated meats and roasted vegetables will give you delicious results. 6. Check for sugar in canned foods Canned foods can be a useful and inexpensive addition to your diet, but they can also contain a lot of added sugar. Fruits and vegetables contain naturally occurring sugars. However, these aren't usually an issue since they don't affect your blood sugar the same way added sugar does. Avoid canned foods that are packed in syrup or have sugar on the ingredient list. Fruit is sweet enough, so go for versions labeled \"packed in water\" or \"no added sugar.\" If you buy canned fruits or vegetables that do have added sugar, you can remove some of it by rinsing them in water before you eat them. 7. Be careful with \"healthy\" processed snack foods Some processed snack foods have a \"health halo.\" They seem healthy at first glance, and words like \"wholesome\" or \"natural\" may be used in their marketing to make them seem healthier than they actually are. Surprisingly, these snacks (such as granola bars, protein bars, and dried fruit) can contain just as much sugar as chocolate and candy bars. Dried fruit is a great example. It's full of fiber, nutrients, and antioxidants. However, it also contains concentrated amounts of natural sugar (and some versions may be \"candied\" with additional added sugar), so you should moderate your intake to keep from overdoing it. Here are some healthy low sugar snack ideas: nuts and seeds, no-sugar-added jerky, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit. 8. Limit sugary breakfast foods Some breakfast cereals can be loaded with added sugar. One report found that some of the most popular ones contained more than half their weight in added sugar. One cereal in the report contained more than 12 teaspoons (50 grams) per serving, making it 88% sugar by weight. What's more, the report found that granola, which is usually marketed as a health food, has more sugar than any other type of cereal, on average. Popular breakfast foods — such as pancakes, waffles, muffins, and jams — are also loaded with added sugar. Save those sugary breakfasts for special occasions and try these low sugar breakfasts instead: oatmeal sweetened with fresh fruit, Greek yogurt with fruit and nuts, egg scramble with cheese and veggies, avocado on whole grain toast. Choosing a low sugar option with plenty of protein and fiber at breakfast will also help you feel full until lunchtime, preventing unnecessary snacking. 9. Read labels Eating less sugar isn't as easy as just avoiding sweet foods. You've already seen that it can hide in unlikely foods such as ketchup and granola. Fortunately, food manufacturers are now required to disclose added sugars on food labels. You'll see added sugars listed under total carbohydrates on foods that contain them. Alternatively, you can check the ingredient list for sugar. The higher on the ingredient list sugar appears, the more sugar the item contains, since ingredients are listed from the highest amount to the lowest amount used by weight. However, there are more than 50 names for added sugar on food labels, which makes it more difficult to spot. Here are some of the most common: high fructose corn syrup, cane sugar or cane juice, maltose, dextrose, invert sugar, rice syrup, molasses, caramel. 10. Consider eating more protein A high sugar intake has been linked to increased appetite and weight gain. Conversely, a diet low in added sugar but high in protein and fiber may have the opposite effect, reducing hunger and promoting fullness. Protein has also been shown to directly reduce food cravings. One study found that increasing protein in the diet by 25% reduced cravings by 60%. To curb sugar cravings, stock up on protein-rich whole foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, full-fat dairy products, avocados, and nuts. 11. Switch to natural zero-calorie sweeteners There are several artificial sweeteners on the market that are totally free of sugar and calories, such as sucralose and aspartame. However, these artificial sweeteners may be linked to imbalances in gut bacteria that can lead to poorer blood sugar control, increased food cravings, and weight gain. For this reason, it may be best to avoid artificial sweeteners too. Some other natural zero-calories sweeteners show promise. These include stevia, erythritol, monk fruit, and allulose. They are all naturally derived, although they do go through some processing before they arrive at your local grocery store. Still, research on these sugar alternatives is ongoing. 12. Limit items with high sugar content in the house If you keep high sugar foods in the house, you may be more likely to eat them. It takes a lot of willpower to stop yourself if you only have to go as far as the pantry or fridge to get a sugar hit. However, if you live with others it can be hard to keep certain foods out of the house — so you may want to have a plan in place for when sugar cravings strike. Studies have shown that distractions, such as doing puzzles, can be very effective at reducing cravings. If that doesn't work, then try to keep some healthy low sugar snacks in the house to munch on instead. 13. Get enough sleep Good sleep habits are incredibly important for your health. Poor sleep has been linked to depression, poor concentration, reduced immune function, and obesity. However, lack of sleep may also affect the types of food you eat, predisposing you to choices that are higher in sugar, fat, salt, and calories. One study found that people who went to bed late and didn't get a full night's sleep consumed more calories, fast food, and soda and fewer fruits and vegetables than those who went to bed earlier and got a full night's sleep. Additionally, a recent observational study noted that higher intakes of added sugar were associated with an increased risk of insomnia in postmenopausal women. If you're struggling to stop making high sugar food choices, getting better sleep may help you regain some control. The bottom line Most Americans get way too much added sugar in their diet. A diet high in added sugar can be harmful and is associated with many chronic health conditions, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. It's important to limit obvious sources of sugar in your diet, such as desserts and sodas, but you should also be aware of the hidden sugar in some other common foods — like sauces, low fat foods, and processed snacks. To be fully in control of your added sugar intake, choose a diet based on whole foods rather than highly processed alternatives.",

    "title": "Engineering for the Why",
    "content": "Several years ago, I remember a particularly wise-for-his-age engineer telling me how members of our team just did things. \"They don't think! They just do!\" he said in frustration one day. At the time, I wasn't sure exactly what he was talking about (let alone how to fix it!) but I did have a general sense that something wasn't right. At the time, I was a new-ish Engineering manager in a department that was rapidly growing and would have multiple fits and starts (and way too much drama!) over the few years I was there. I had a lot to learn. This complaint would come up over and over, and he would keeping saying members of the team \"weren't doing it right.\" Last Fall, we got together for coffee and this observation came up again. Things hadn't changed. Or maybe he hadn't changed. But I have. These days, I have a much better vocabulary to describe this behavior and a lot more experience doing it wrong and seeing it done wrong to truly get what he meant all those years ago. One way to describe the phenomenon is when a team focuses more on activities than on outcomes. I've seen this at multiple levels and in different roles from executives to product management down to individual engineers. This incredibly common way that organizations think about work manifests itself in various unhelpful behaviors that hold us back individually and as teams. Whether it is a product owner, engineering leader, or someone that checks in code daily, everyone appears busy. Stuff happens. Red/green/yellow \"traffic-light\" slide decks are produced. Tickets are closed. Customers may even get new features. Releases come and go. Deals might even close, but something is missing. Just working is easy, however painful it may seem at times. But working on the right things (and haggling over what is \"right\") is much harder. Getting consensus and clarity about what not to work on, and identifying who and when you can safely say \"No!\" to is even tougher. For some teams, dare I say impossible. It is just how we are naturally wired as humans. We want to please. We are generally conflict-averse. It is easier to take the well-worn path and keep our heads down and just do it. Unfortunately, overly superficial Agile metrics sometimes help reinforce our attempts to stay busy and focus on activity over outcomes. What does your burndown chart look like? How many story points did the team complete this sprint? What is your say-do ratio? These aren't particularly helpful in measuring outcomes, but they certainly prove things are getting done. Maybe. Sometimes they even make us feel good about ourselves and what we are accomplishing. Eyes Wide Open Being an individual contributor again for a few months now, I feel like I've been granted a gift to see things that I couldn't see before as a manager, that sometimes I couldn't feel as a leader. As an engineer again, I now have the white spaces on my calendar I could never seem to find when I managed people. Working in a slower-moving organization after years of fire-fighting gives you time to stop, think, and reflect. Most importantly, joining an organization outside the leadership circle and with no accountability for anyone but yourself provides a very different perspective on what works and doesn't work on teams and why because you simply don't have the same skin in the game. Hearing the things IC's share with each other and what they talk about compared to the discourse between managers, directors, and VP's has been fascinating and eye-opening. It confirmed some of the suspicions I had when I was a leader that messages are too frequently misinterpreted, misunderstood, or simply tuned-out at the lower levels. (This is obviously the point of asking lots of questions and doing the hard work listening and driving clarity in your 1:1's and skip-level's with your team, but I digress.) Within high-performing teams, leaders continuously effuse mission, purpose, and context. The why is communicated everywhere and in every interaction. You feel it. You know it. It is repeated. There is focus and clarity in the messaging from managers and leaders. There is a richness that goes beyond sound bites, buzzwords, and corporate platitudes that are so quickly mocked by the rank and file as soon as the quarterly all-hands is over. In organizations that effectively define and communicate their missions, there are ready-made narratives that new (or not so new) team members can easily latch onto when the business responds to internal and external threats or adapts to a changing environment. The reasons for doing things (whether launching a new product, making a major technology shift or a minor process change, or perhaps something scarier like a lay-off or a reorg) all make much more sense when there is a frame of reference and intentional flow of context. If these narratives are true (well, or at least consistent) they can provide an antidote to the alternative narratives (call them conspiracy theories if you like) that propagate and run rampant when there is conflict among teams, when folks get frustrated or burn out, or when times generally get tough. Furthermore, if the why is clear enough, it can allow healthy, productive conflict around the what and the how. It also avoids organizational navel-gazing, which can be counterproductive or divisive. Obviously, leaders must believe these narratives. They must be authentic. And yeah, this is much easier said than done. Alignment is really hard. In the military, there is the concept of \"commander's intent\" that I keep falling back to as useful metaphor right balance of delegation that is required in properly mission-focused teams. When troops or front-line NCO's understand the mission and they are granted the autonomy and flexibility to accomplish the mission using the \"ground truth\" that only they possess, this is when \"empowered execution\" happens. This is the opposite of the much-maligned \"command-and-control\" leadership style that \"servant leaders\" like to talk about in anti-management strains of Agile. Growing up in an Army family during the last gasp of Cold War, I remember hearing stories (call it propaganda if you like) of how U.S. soldiers would be able \"think for themselves\" and would keep on fighting if their leaders were killed or they were \"cut off\", unlike what would happen to Soviet soldiers. Sure we were outnumbered, but we were better! We could think for ourselves! We weren't automatons like the other side. Obviously, World War III never happened, but 20th Century U.S. military history (especially before 1960) is full of many successful examples where senior leaders provided the strategic and operational context for the mission, but execution was left to those closest to the front. A side effect of this sort of \"empowered execution\" improved accountability because folks can't make the \"I was just following orders\" if the mission fails. They must own it. Worse than Micro-Management Working in mid-size product companies, you get a chance to see micromanagement laid bare in a variety of forms, ranging from executive \"napkin architectures\" to support requests from to individual engineers and everything in between. There is no shortage of \"helpful\" solutions to problems they have not been fully defined or adequately vetted, so that people immediately jump on them — or want your team to jump on them: Just run this SQL query for our data warehouse and don't ask any questions. Your UI MUST be this color. Just because. Give me SSH access to this server so I can run this script. Don't use cloud-provider Managed Services so we can run On Prem! Can't you just? How hard could that be? (You get the point.) Leading operations and security teams, I would encourage my engineers to push back on these \"predetermined solutions\" to drive deeper discussions about intent. What problems are you trying to solve? What is the larger context or system? What is the end goal? What are you trying to do here and why Because security and infrastructure teams are often the bottleneck/blocker/gatekeeper for new things that are being built or deployed, they are in a unique position to uncover ill-conceived ideas and initiatives and driver larger WTF discussions across the organization and with the business. This is a blessing and curse. The TLDR is that engineers want problems they can solve, not solutions they must follow from a script. We are not order-takers. Don't just do what people want you to. They simply don't understand the infrastructure, the implementation, or how things work. This anti-pattern can happen at the engineer to engineer (or manager to engineer) level but also between the product management and engineering orgs. In both cases, it must be kept in check. Unfortunately, in the vicious cycle of getting shit done (I've heard leaders promote \"GSD\" as a model for what should be rewarded), we rack up technical debt and build products and features that customers may never use until it all comes tumbling down. As an engineering leader, you must constantly watch yourself so that you do not abuse your position of authority to stray into the how. This doesn't mean you don't think about the how. It doesn't mean you check out from the solution space, but you have to resist the temptation to tell others how to do the work. This is the only way to have any chance of building a learning organization. One way to do this is to focus on non-leading questions. And if you provide a technical suggestion provide ample caveat's that what you might be stupid, ill-informed, or generally terrible. Not the Daily Three Questions Agile is full of useful \"three-word\" phrases (start/stop/continue, yesterday/today/blockers, and these \"3 Amigos\" I recently heard about but have no idea what they are) but something I've settled upon over the years for framing the definition work is three simple words: outcomes, assumptions, unknowns. I'm pretty sure I didn't come up with this on my own. I got help. Even though these 3 words are compatible with \"user stories\" or \"acceptance criteria,\" I've found that using Agile terminology can be unhelpful because people think they know how to write user stories well (they don't!) or can define clear acceptance criteria (they won't!) and just doing these two rituals often leads to an ill-defined or uncritical definition of done. Lastly, jargon has side-effects that I've found turn people off or shut people down. Keeping things simple (even if somewhat more ambiguous) can result in a \"mind-open\" state that we want on our teams and in ourselves. Starting with outcomes drives discussion at a higher level of abstraction and delays prematurely getting into the weeds. These three words can be used to define larger initiatives (call them epics if you want) or smaller bits of work (stories or tasks) but can be a helpful antidote to focusing on \"the what\" instead of \"the why.\" In my experience, ticketing systems such as JIRA (yeah, especially JIRA) tend to draw engineers into that trap of prematurely defining \"the what\" that needs be done without clearly allowing discussion of \"the why\" or the \"why not\" to be fully explored. And of course, it discourages the examination of the mountain of assumptions and dependencies that the piece of work depends on — and the unknowns that will result in endless discovery and rework. Ticketing systems make it very difficult to visualize the work as a whole or in relation to other systems or activities. Tickets can become an unhelpful \"todo list\" that is too low-level too soon. This prematurely narrows the solution set before clearly mining the problem set. Jumping to the solution before clearly understanding (and debating and communicating) the problem is one of the mortal sins of engineering. This is why I prefer taking notes in Word Online or a notepad and NOT editing directly in JIRA or Rally. There is something about jumping into a web tool that shuts off people's brains. Rant over. In the beginning, product and engineering leaders might have to jump-start this definition of outcomes, but eventually, this should be a back and forth discussion about the target state given the constraints. You want engineers to be thinking about how an end-user's behavior will change when using a feature, what pain-point it will address, or how the system must be changed to achieve the desired results NOT the way the outcome will be achieved or implemented. This is especially true if the ask seems out of the blue or a radical shift in direction, as is bound to happen. Also, when you are talking about outcomes it is also an ideal time to frame them without the purpose of your organization and re-affirm its mission — or clearly say this is a shift in focus. No need to be heavy-handed, but a little repetition never hurts. This leads to the second question. What are we assuming with this chunk of work that must be delivered? What is the prior art? What is the tech stack? Does anyone remember how this could actually be wired up? What are the existing conventions to re-use or reject? The slate is seldom blank, but frequently engineers don't shine the light on what is assumed and you would be surprised how different the assumptions are across even a small team of 5 or 6 engineers, let alone when a feature touches other teams across specializations. Folks are seldom on the same page, in my experience — especially on distributed teams. A clear definition of the constraints or things that are NOT being tackled is critical. Clearly defining the scope to the best of your ability upfront is never a bad thing, even though it could change. It will change, of course. Lastly, and most importantly after defining the desired end state, ask what don't you know now that you probably should? The team should do its best to enumerate questions and areas where there must be discovery work. Channeling Rumsfeld, what are the \"known unknowns?\" This might be the time to attempt a \"premortem\" to work backward from projected failure to deliver on time or if we fail to all the desired outcomes. Smaller features using existing tech or tooling may have very little here, but if the team can't define any questions about what you don't know, then perhaps the work isn't ambitious enough or provide enough opportunity for learning. For Further Reading and Thinking This is obviously just a starting point but at over 2000 words it is long enough. This is as good as it gets. I heavily borrowed from the following books I've read (or mostly read, and sometimes re-read) over the last few years: One Mission: How Leaders Build a Team of Teams, by Chris Fussell , C. W. Goodyear , et al. The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business, by Patrick M.

    "title": "11 Email Marketing Lessons from the Pros",
    "content": "There's a lot to learn when you're entering the world of email marketing for the first time. Even though it'd be nice to know how to get a good ROI from email on the first go, it takes time and experience to learn best practices. You'll need to understand how to best leverage email automation, write the perfect subject line, and build a quality email list. You'll gain some insights through reading the latest studies and research, and other insights through your own unique experiences. There may not be shortcuts that always do the trick, but there are loads of seasoned email experts who can offer their best advice to those starting out. Today, you're in luck. We've reached out to some of the top email marketing experts to find out what they wish someone had told them when they were getting started. The email marketing lessons they've learned over the years will definitely help you avoid some hurdles. What is the best way to do email marketing? Learn from the experts: 1. Henneke Duistermaat – Copywriting & Marketing Expert at Enchanting Marketing Tweetable: Unsubscribes can be a good thing. I wish I'd understood that unsubscribes are good. In the beginning, I was distraught when people unsubscribed. Did they hate my writing? Was I emailing too often? Was I too boring? Over time, I've learned you can't please everyone. The emails that bring you closer to your raving fans are often the emails that turn off subscribers in the periphery. Now I prune my lists a few times a year. Removing people who aren't that interested in hearing from me feels like a good cleaning job. Plus, I've learned to write for my core fans only. It's more fun for me, and more valuable for my subscribers too. 2. Kevan Lee – Director of Marketing at Buffer Tweetable: From name and subject line are extremely important. When I started email marketing, I spent so much time on design and body copy that I completely neglected perhaps the two most important—definitely the most primary—aspects of a successful email: the subject line and \"From\" name. Subject lines were the easier ones to correct. It felt a lot like brainstorming blog post titles. But testing the impact of the \"From\" name was something I never considered until much later on. If people trust you, they'll more likely open your email… so it's important to get people to recognize that the email is from you. 3. Joanna Wiebe, Founder of CopyHackers and AirStory Tweetable: Send when you have something valuable to share. When I was getting started, I wish I'd known not to worry about the frequency of sends. You hear not to email too much, and then you hear that you should email every day or once a week. But what I've learned over the last 15 years of email marketing is the simpler, better lesson: Email when you've got something relevant to share. That could happen daily, or it could happen in fits. Relevant content leads to better open and click-through rates. So, if you're always adding value to your subscriber's life—whether with a great new post or a must-have offer—send away. If you're not adding value, don't send the email. 4. Sujan Patel, Co-founder of WebProfits Tweetable: Use email marketing in all customer acquisition channels. I wish someone would have told me that I should be using email marketing in all my customer acquisition channels, not just in my marketing efforts. For example, I've recently started pulling out email subscribers from my list that have a higher chance of converting to customers and creating separate, more personalized and more sales-focused sequences for them. Breaking down the barriers between sales and marketing, in general, is something I wish I would've started a long time ago. Given how versatile of an acquisition tactic email marketing is, it's a no-brainer to start that process with it. 5. Ali Rastiello, Sr. Manager of Marketing Automation at BigCommerce Tweetable: Integrate your marketing messages across different platforms. I wish I would've known to integrate my email marketing messages with different channels. This may seem obvious, but it's the biggest mistake I made in my early days—and that I see marketers still making today. The content you choose for email should be part of a holistic campaign. It's not enough to hope that your email programs will drive all conversions. Your paid media, social media, and event strategy should all incorporate the same messaging points and align with the marketing funnel to achieve maximum impact. Essentially, you have to market with purpose. 6. Kath Pay, Founder of Holistic Email Marketing Tweetable: Think about your audience and be as relevant as possible for them. I began in email marketing in 1998 and everything I now know wasn't necessarily applicable back then, as the consumer's expectations were completely different to nowadays. But I wish I'd known back then that email marketing is not about the channel, nor the sending technology; it's about the individuals that are receiving the email. It's about making the email/offer/content as relevant and valuable to them as possible. It's about leading with marketing and letting technology bring it to life, not the other way around. 7. Jordie van Rijn, Email Marketing Consultant at eMailMonday Tweetable: Optimize email efforts for subscriber lifetime value–not campaign activity. When I started out, email reporting metrics led me and everyone to believe that success is top engagement (open rate, click rate) and revenue per email campaign. That is what you want, right? Wrong. Campaign-based data will only take you so far because average email stats don't tell the whole story of the underlying groups. Each email to a person will influence the success of the next one to that person. If we want to get better results from your subscribers, we need to optimize on subscriber lifetime value—not on campaigns. 8. Val Geisler, B2C Email Expert Tweetable: When it comes to email: Test, test, and test some more. I wish I knew that testing is the name of the game. I honestly thought I'd set up my list, the template, the structure, etc. and just stick with one thing forever and ever. That's not the best approach though. Your audience evolves, you evolve, and your list of subscribers evolves. You have to constantly test and measure the results to find out what works best for your email marketing game plan. 9. Justin Khoo, Founder of FreshInbox Tweetable: Use preheaders to double the length of your subject line. I wish I'd known about the importance of preheaders. The fact that you can double the length of your visible subject line with some clever HTML techniques to place key text at the very top of your email is so valuable—and often overlooked. Plus: This text can be hidden so that it doesn't clutter the email when opened. 10. Kayli Barth, Director of Email Marketing at MTL NewTech Tweetable: Leverage segmentation for more personalized experiences. For me, I wish I'd known more about segmentation. Now, when I'm planning a campaign, I always want to know more about who my audience is individually so I can create a more personalized, targeted experience that would a) add value to the right people and b) keep those unsubscribe numbers down. But, when I started building my list, I didn't think about how important this would be down the line. And, honestly, everything I read on the subject just kind of made my head spin…so I ignored it. That's a lesson I've learned along the way. 11. Chad White, Research Director at Litmus Tweetable: Understand the complexity of email rendering. When I first started in email marketing in 2006, I was focused on email messaging and strategy. I wish I'd understood from the beginning how inconsistent email client support for coding is and therefore how complex email rendering is. For marketers who now understand that the new challenge is to avoid creating consistency by playing down to the lowest common denominator. Instead of trying to create \"pixel-perfect\" emails, marketers need to use progressive enhancement thoughtfully to create \"platform-perfect\" emails that deliver the best experiences for users of key email clients. Key takeaways: email marketing lessons to incorporate into your marketing strategy Our experts shared a lot of important tips that, when put into practice, can help you create an even better email marketing campaign. Let's review some of their key email marketing lessons. How do you create an effective email marketing campaign? Implement these tips. 1. Pay attention to your unsubscribe rate. It's a great feeling whenever someone subscribes to your email list, but it can feel downright discouraging when someone unsubscribes to your list. Remember: you can't please everyone—and you don't want to. Your focus should be on your ideal customer and target audience. People who stick around are those who value what you have to offer, and you can be sure that your time and effort isn't going to waste on them. 2. Email marketing 101: pay close attention to your subject line. Of all the important email marketing lessons, this one is close to the top of every email marketer's list—focus on your subject line. The email subject line is basically your first impression. To ensure you make a good one, keep your subject lines short and sweet. Make sure they fit the content of your email, as well as the interests of your audience. 3. Email only when you have something relevant to say. A lot of marketers get caught up in the idea that they need to email their subscriber list constantly. Some people are under the impression that there's a magic formula when it comes to how often they send emails. Perhaps they've watched an email marketing tutorial with step-by-step guides that show you the ideal send frequency. Here are two things to remember when it comes to how often to send emails: Send emails when you have something of value to share with your audience. Your brand and audience will determine how often you need to send emails. Some brands have audiences and products/services that require daily emails. That's not for everyone, though. Figure out what your audience wants and send emails that are full of value. Remember, relevant content will result in better click-through and open rates. 4. Market with a purpose. To achieve maximum impact, you need to make sure all of your marketing channels are in alignment. This includes: Email marketing, Social media marketing, Event strategy, Paid media. All these channels should incorporate the same message to your audience. This ensures that, no matter what platform your ideal customer is on, they'll recognize your message and brand. 5. Your emails should be about the recipient. A lot of email marketing programs will teach you step-by-step strategies to increase your open and click-through rates. That's great—unless they forget one of the most important email marketing lessons: that your emails are not all about you, your brand, the email design, or sending technology. Your emails should be all about the person who receives them. Make sure the content fits the needs and desires of your audience, and you'll quickly see an improvement in your open, click-through, and conversion rates. Wrap up Be sure to take notes on the tips these email marketing experts have shared to keep you and your team from repeating some of the hard-learned email marketing lessons they've experienced firsthand. From optimizing customer journeys to crafting the right copy within email and beyond, they've shed some light on ways to improve your email efforts.",

    "title": "How I Force Myself to Work",
    "content": "No one seems to be immune to procrastinating, myself included. Some people get drawn into social media, for others it's YouTube or ProductHunt. I, however, tend to lose whole days on Wikipedia and development communities. Everyone has their poison. If you really are one of these odd people who don't know what procrastination is, check out this video. Got distracted again while you should have finished that project? You are in the right place. Keep on reading! After trying numerous ways to keep myself coding or writing, I've finally found something that works for me. Hard cut: \"/etc/hosts\" and \"127.0.0.1\" For a while I've used custom entries in my hosts file /etc/hosts redirecting some DNS requests to my local machine to die there. It's hard 404 to remind myself that I got distracted again and broke the flow. This worked well, but occasionally I had to find a solution to a coding issue and had to switch particular sites off. It became a habit of switching off the whole list as it was easier. And that is where old habits got the best of me. Breaking Procrastination using a browser extension There are numerous browser extensions aiming to help victims of their habits like myself with their problem. Most of these didn't win me over as they either limited my browser too much or were simply not thought through enough. The deprocrastination.co extension did a much better job here. I loved the ability to control access to certain sites and have dedicated blocks of effort. It worked well until the point I simply had to use one of the sites that were included in my block list. I had to break the timer or exclude the site manually. Another little annoyance was that YouTube, my source of background music, was usually running. It wasn't affected by the extension as long as I didn't switch to the tab accidentally. My habit of jumping around my browser tabs using keyboard shortcuts got me into trouble regularly. Managing \"/etc/hosts\" version 2 As a regular reader of Mattias Geniar's Newsletter cron.weekly, I've recently discovered a neat command-line tool to manage your \"/etc/hosts\"-file better: hostctl! It allows you to predefine sets of host entries and to switch them on and off using commands: # This will enable the blocks for mails by redirecting each domain to localhost. hostctl enable nomail; # This will disable the block and allow me to connect again. hostctl disable nomail; # Alternatively, you can use the toggle command: hostctl toggle nomail; # Note: I've actually got aliases for both. Simply add it to your ~/.bash_aliases I've added some five sets to my hosts file. The sets are grouped by topics, for example. In addition, I've added another bash alias called \"work\". It enables all block profiles at once and makes sure I keep working. If I really need to access a site, I switch off the block for the set using an alias (for example \"mail\") and run a \"sleep 120; work\" to keep myself from going down some rabbit hole. Too technical for you? If this approach is too technical for you, you might want to check out the extension mentioned above. It's a great solution if hostctl is too technical and kept me on track for a long time. If this post or the video on top helped you to procrastinate it might be time to try either the extension or hostctl. Give it a try! If you struggle to make your projects work in general you might want to have a look at my personal Indie Hacker Rules - a set of ideas how to push myself more. I've also written about what I consider good habits and traits for Indie Hackers. Both articles might be worth spending a few minutes on, if you made it until here.",

    "content": "Procrastination is a fascinating and complex psychological phenomenon that affects almost everyone at some point in their lives. The reason we procrastinate is not simply because we're lazy or lack willpower, but rather due to a complex interplay between our brain's reward system, our emotional state, and our perception of tasks. When we face a task that seems difficult, boring, or overwhelming, our brain's limbic system (the part responsible for emotions and immediate gratification) often overrides our prefrontal cortex (responsible for planning and decision-making). This creates what psychologists call 'temporal discounting,' where we value immediate rewards over long-term benefits. The procrastinator's brain is essentially at war with itself, with the emotional brain winning out over the rational brain. Understanding this internal conflict is the first step toward developing better strategies for overcoming procrastination.",
